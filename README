== Welcome ART-O-THEK ==

This is a showcase project for using Ruby on Rails with the following features and technologies.
You can mainly manage your collection of CDs (or any other media which is based on artists, albums and tracks).

Particular features include:

- Anonymous users can register (without email confirmation by now)
- Anonymous users can seach for artists, albums and tracks
- registered users can manage artists (CRUD)
- registered users can manage albums (associated with users/artists)
- registered users can manage tracks for their albums
- Anonymous and registered users can comment on albums

Some technologies used in this project are:

- HAML for the views
- Apotomo widgets for some partials
- Devise for user management
- Thinking Sphinx for search (requires Sphinx and MySQL/PostgreSQL, SQLite3 not supported)
- Cucumber for acceptance testing
- acts_as_commentable for comment feature on albums
- Paperclip for the upload and processing of album covers

= TODOs =

- Search not executed right now although indexes defined in Album model
- Cucumber features broken due to some routes refactored
- rspec model tests (validations etc.)
- pagination of artists, albums
- Ajaxification
- Capistrano recipe needed to deploy without pain

= License =

Do whatever you want with this ;)
